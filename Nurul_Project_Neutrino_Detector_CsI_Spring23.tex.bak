\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The muon is one of Nature’s fundamental particles. Its discovery in 1937 by Carl Anderson marked a radical departure in
physicists' understanding of the building blocks of matter. Although it was first assigned a place in theory of nuclear
forces which was incorrect, it is now understood to be an important member of the lepton family of particles.

The muon is produced copiously in Earth’s atmosphere by interactions between cosmic rays and atmospheric air molecules,
and its flux at sea level is sufficient for investigations. Cosmic ray proton interact with atmospheric nuclei and create pions,
which decay into muons within short distance as meters.
The dominant muon decay model (sometime called Michel decay) is a $3$-body decay model. A muon decay
into an electron, electron anti-neutrino, and muon neutrino.

\begin{eqnarray}
&&\hspace*{0.0cm} \pi^+(u\bar{d})\rightarrow \nu_{\mu}+\mu^+,
\label{1eq:1}\\
&&\hspace*{0.0cm} \pi^-(d\bar{u})\rightarrow \bar{\nu_{\mu}}+\mu^-,
\label{1eq:2}\\
&&\hspace*{0.0cm} \mu^+\rightarrow e^++\nu_e+\bar{\nu_{\mu}},
\label{1eq:3}\\
&&\hspace*{0.0cm} \mu^-\rightarrow e^-+\nu_{\mu}+\bar{\nu_e},
\label{1eq:4}
\end{eqnarray}

The muon’s lifetime can be measured using experimental techniques common to nuclear and particle physics. The stopping rate of
muons, as a function of depth in the atmosphere, can be used as a demonstration of the time dilation effect of special relativity.
Since the decay times of individual radioactive particles are randomly distributed, they are a convenient source of genuinely
random numbers. These can be used to demonstrate common probability distributions.

\subsection{The Hardware}
Figure 1a shows the block diagram for muon hardware.
The complete instrument has three hardware components: a detector, readout electronics and user-supplied
personal computer (PC). Control and data acquisition software are also included.

\subsection{Detector Module}
A $16.5~cm$ diameter by $36~cm$ tall black anodized aluminum cylinder houses the entire detector module
including the plastic scintillator, photomultiplier tube (PMT), and high voltage supply (HV) as well
as electronics for an imbedded light emitting diode (LED). The scintillator, a right circular cylinder,
is optically coupled to a single $5~cm$ diameter 10-stage PMT. Because all of the circuitry for
the PMT is mounted inside the aluminum cylinder, there are no exposed HV electrodes. The HV is
manually controlled and monitored by external controls. The thickness of the scintillator assures that
either muon passage through or decay within the scintillator produces a quantity of light well
above the PMT threshold. The imbedded LED can be driven by the adjustable pulser to mimic muon
decays and to test the readout electronics. Inside the aluminum cylinder, light tight wrapping on
both the scintillator and PMT prevent light leaks.

\subsection{Electronics Module}
The electronics module houses all electronics needed to run the experiment. Connections on the front
panel allow us not only to examine the PMT signal itself, but also to monitor that signal as it moves
along the readout chain. PMT pulses are first amplified and compared against an adjustable threshold.
Pulses above threshold are sent to timing circuitry implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip.
The first flash of the scintillator starts the timing system. If a second flash occurs within $20~\mu s$ of
the first, the readout electronics measures the time between the two flashes and passes that time to the
lifetime display software. If no second flash occurs within $20~\mu s$, the pulse is simply recorded as a
charged particle that has passed through the detector. Communication circuitry transfers the data to our PC
through USB port.

\subsection{The Software}
Data acquisition of muon decay times is computer controlled to eliminate the tedium of recording numbers
and to permit extended data collection times. The decay time histogram is automatically updated with data
from the readout electronics. Important display features like the histogram bin size and the logarithmic/linear
axis type remain under user control. A password-protected built-in curve fitting algorithm allows for easy
determination of the muon lifetime which is maintaining Dr. Juergen Reichenbacher. Raw data are written to
disk files in a compact format so that we can export them to our own software package.

\section{Experiments and Data Analysis}
Measuring the muon lifetime using the TeachSpin apparatus is very straightforward. As we know that the muon lifetime is
very short at rest or very low kinetic energy. But when it travels with very high energy it can stay longer
in our reference frame because of the special relativity. In our atmosphere positive and negative muons can
produce via the pions ($\pi^{\pm}$) decay [ref. eq. 1 and 2]. For my experiment, I collected two data sets. First data
set was for only $186$ muon-decays, which was taken for $8100~s$ during my lab day. Then I left the experiment running for
additional 7 days to collect large data for better statistics. The large data set was for 20582 muon-decay corresponding to $7.4$ days.

Experimental main goal was to measure the mean muon lifetime in organic scintillator. The form for the decay time distribution
for muons stopped in the scintillator is characteristic of the decay of radioactive substances with some background counts.
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\hspace*{0.0cm} N(t)=N_0~e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}+B,
\label{1eq:5}
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $N(t)$, $N_0$, $t$, $\tau$, and $B$ repersent final number of muons, initial number of muons at time $t=0$, time in $ns$,
mean lifetime of muon, and background (free parameter), respectively.
Additional background counts can be easily induced by bringing a 1 micro-Curie Cs-137 source close to the detector. In my case
I did not counts additional background. After collecting the data for muon lifetime from the PC, I plotted the distribution of
times between successive scintillator flashes using ROOT and a micro provided by Dr. Juergen Reichenbacher. I fitted the
exponential-like distribution, equation $5$, to extract
muon mean lifetime $\tau$.

Figure 2a and 3a show the full distributions for 186, and 20582 muons lifetime, respectively. After fitting my data using simple
function (eq. 5), I found the mean muon lifetime is $(1.915\pm 0.214) ~ \mu s$, which is shown in figure 2b. Also, for 20582 muon events,
mean muon lifetime was $(2.092\pm0.022)~\mu s$, which is shown in fig. 3b. Specially, from fig. 3b with high statistic it is seen that the
mean lifetime of muon is significantly less than the free space value $t=(2.197\pm0.001)~\mu s$, which correctly indicates the effect of
nuclear capture of negative muons on $C-12$ nuclei.

\begin{eqnarray}
&&\hspace*{0.0cm} N(t)=A~e^{\frac{-t}{2197~ns}}+B~e^{\frac{-t}{\tau_{\mu^-}}}+C,
\label{1eq:6}
\end{eqnarray}
With this instrument, the muon lifetime measured in plastic scintillator is an average over negatively and positively charged muons. Negatively
charged muons can undergo nuclear capture that slightly lessen their lifetime in matter. Therefore, using the lifetime of positive muons in carbon
taken from the literature (tau = 2.197 ± 0.003 µsec), the sea-level charge ratio of positive to negative muons at low energy , Eµ = 200 MeV, can be easily determined.
From eq.6, we can measure the negative muon lifetime by using $\mu^+=2197~ns$.
From fig. 4, I found that the negative muon lifetime is 2192 (1807) $ns$ for total events number 186 (20582). My large data set is statistically rich (20582 events
within 7.4 days). So, from fig. 4b I can measure the sea level charge ratio $\mu^+/\mu^-=1.4\pm0.006$.

\section{Error Analysis and results}
The fitted muon charge ratio for large data set is $1.4\pm0.006$, which is a bit higher than some published value $1.08\pm0.01$ (Ref. www.TeachSpin.com).
To calculate the muon charge ratio I have used the below equation as:
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\hspace*{0.0cm} \frac{\mu^+}{\mu^-}=-\frac{\tau^-}{\tau^+}\times\frac{\tau^--\tau_{exp}}{\tau^+-\tau_{exp}},
\label{1eq:7}
\end{eqnarray}
where, $\tau^-=(1807\pm160.9)~ns$, $\tau^+=(2197\pm0.007)~ns$, and $\tau_{exp}=(2058\pm26.48)~ns$. Here, $\tau_{exp}$
is my experimentally observer muon average lifetime for large data set (figure 4b).
Statistically, the result of $\tau_{exp}=(2058\pm26.48)~ns$ is excellent; simply by assuming a uniform distribution
to represent any background interference, our fit gives a coefficient of
determination $\chi^2$ value of nearly $1$—specifically $0.9373$. Without a doubt, our
data demonstrate the exponential behavior of the muon decay distribution,
validating the predicted theoretical behavior derived under the assumption
of a uniform decay rate.

\section{Conclusion}
Muon is a fundamental natural particle. Muon study is very important part of particle physics and also, have lots of application in variety of sectors.
Muon decay has great importance to study the week interaction, and also muon are using to detect dangerous nuclear materials. Muon's lifetime is well
known. In this experiment, I measured the muon lifetime and their charge ratio in the see level by using the TeachSpin.com apparatus. Here, I used organic scintillator
detector to measure the muon lifetime. When muons, produced in our Earth's atmosphere, enter into the detector and hit the scintillating material produce charged particle
like electrons. In that way muon decay into the detector and creating charged particle which produce light. In the next step, photo-multiplier tube (PMT) can sense these
light and amplify it to produce huge amount of electrons. And finally, send it as a voltage output. Then I collected the data from PC to measure the average muon lifetime.
Form the above analysis about muon lifetime, I think this experiment was very helpful to understand the basic about the muon particle.
